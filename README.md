# PhoneAppsDemo
This is an application demonstrating basic apps in a mobile phone through editor console user platform, it contains a phone book and a messages apps.
As required it contains a phone book txt file, a contacts list and out going messages bin files.
There is an infrastructure in place to accommodate future requirements of a calendar app and incoming messages list.
Much improvment is needed to better the code, and user experience, but more time is needed and that's done.
